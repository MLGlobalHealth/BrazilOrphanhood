# Samples from quantities of interest

The majority of the sample we generate/use are here. Some are too large to be stored on GitHub, these are:
- `femalefertility_age_group_child_age_uf.RDS`
- `orphanhood_age_group_child_age_sex_uf_allcause.RDS`
- `orphanhood_age_group_child_age_sex_uf_excess.RDS`

For now, please contact us for these files. We are currently working to make them more accessible.
