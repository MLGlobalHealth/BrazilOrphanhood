# Child mortality data

Complete life tables were obtained from IBGE [here](https://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/index.php/biblioteca-catalogo?view=detalhes&id=73097). These contain the probability of death for individuals in each single-year age-group. We collate the individual files into a single file ``lifetables.csv``, containing the probability of death for individuals aged 0-to-18 for years 2002-to-2020.
