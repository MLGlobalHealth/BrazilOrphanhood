# Mortality data

Samples were obtained from Ponmattam et al. 2024 (under preparation). These are processed by the scripts `process_bayesian_excessmortality.R` and `process_frequentist_excessmortality.R`, which produce files `excess_mortality_bayesian.csv` and `excess_mortality_frequentist.csv`, respectively.

These files contain the reported deaths, so are also the source of all-cause mortality data.
